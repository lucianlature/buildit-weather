## Requirements

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/lucianlature/buildit-weather.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Please build a single HTML page displaying the 5 day weather forecast for a location of your choice.

1. Do not spend more than 4 hours on your solution **(even if you do not complete the entire exercise)**.
2. Use the latest specs of HTML, CSS and ECMAScript to implement the solution. At this time, these would be HTML5, CSS3 and ES2016.
3. Use the [OpenWeatherMap 5 day weather forecast API](http://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve the current 5 day weather forecast.
4. Give some thought to what will make a decent user experience. We would like to see something readable but with no need to go all out on sleek and flashy UI elements.
5. Use any supporting technologies, frameworks, package managers, starter kits, build systems and libraries that you are familiar with and feel are appropriate.
6. Assuming a Node.js environment with the latest version installed, please ensure that there are **no globally
installed dependencies required** to build / run your app. If you have to have them please explain why.
This avoids environment issues when trying to build your solution.
7. Provide a README.md file that:
  - Documents how to run / build / test your creation.
  - Documents anything you might implement with more time (features, fixes, technical debt, corrections etc).
8. **Submit** your code into a **public git repository** of your choice (github / bitbucket etc).
9. **Host** your code on a **public web server** of your choice.

## Demo

Please visit the working [demo](https://buildit-technical-test-xwkqdugjyo.now.sh/) hosted by [now](https://zeit.co/now).

To see the source code for it, you need to [browse the files](https://zeit.co/lucian/buildit-technical-test/xwkqdugjyo/source)

Let me know if you would like me to also to push the code into a Git repo.

## Setup
Install it:

```bash
npm install
```
then
```bash
npm build
```

## Run the technical test
```bash
npm start
```

## Running the tests
```bash
npm test
```

## Features
  - built on top of [NextJS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js). Visit [learnnextjs.com](https://learnnextjs.com) to get familiar with Next.js.
  - 👀 `react` as the view.
  - 🚄 `express` server.
  - 🎭 `jest` as the test framework.
  - 🖌 Very basic CSS support - it's up to you to extend it with CSS Modules etc.
  - 🌍 Server Side Rendering.
  - 📦 All source is bundled using Webpack v2.
  - 🚀 Full ES2017+ support - use the exact same JS syntax across the entire project. No more folder context switching! We also only use syntax that is stage-3 or later in the TC39 process.
